#STOP CENSORSHIP

Congress is about to pass internet censorship, even though the vast majority of Americans are opposed. We need to kill the bill - PIPA in the Senate and SOPA in the House - to protect our rights to free speech, privacy, and prosperity.

## Get Involved

Get involved and join me and others by blacking out your website (I will post stop.html as my own web presence) on January 18th from 8am - 8pm EST (1300 - 0100 UTC).
